      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer and synthetic biologist with a firm belief in building from first principles . My goal is to develop systems and tools to engineer living systems from scratch.
I study Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Bioengineering at Berkeley. I currently work for an awesome company called Asimov , developing software to build genetic circuits for mammalian cell lines.
My interests vary, but I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading about or working on projects relating to:</description>
