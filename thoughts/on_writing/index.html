    <p>No one wants to write. Usually in college you&rsquo;re writing about
something boring, and you&rsquo;d rather do anything else.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain permanence to the written word that can be scary.
Thoughts are fleeting and lossy, but there&rsquo;s comfort in this lack of state. Its
easy to confide in your strokes of genius or dismiss stupidity when such musings
pass as quickly as they come.</p>
<p>Distilling a set of complex thoughts into a sentence or paragraph forever
exposes the captured idea to the lens of public scrutiny. It cultivates
accountability. It encourages integrity of thought.</p>
<p>If your public forum is the internet, there are no shortage of scathing tongues
and opposing viewpoints. This is a blessing. Feedback is instant, and writing
becomes a living process that converges towards that objective truth.</p>
<p>To expose your ideas to the limelight of the truth is to see just
how strong the rational bedrock of your thoughts really are. Where do they crumble?
Where do you need to rebuild?</p>
