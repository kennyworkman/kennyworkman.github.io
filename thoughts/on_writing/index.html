    <p>I think writing is inherently scary because its more or less permanent.
Thoughts are fleeting and lossy, but there&rsquo;s comfort in this lack of state. Its
easy to confide in your strokes of genius or dismiss stupidity when such musings
pass as quickly as they come.</p>
<p>Distilling a set of complex thoughts into a sentence or paragraph forever
exposes the captured idea to the lens of public scrutiny. It cultivates
accountability. It encourages integrity of thought.</p>
<p>If your public forum is the internet, there are no shortage of scathing tongues
and opposing viewpoints. This is a blessing. Feedback is instant, and writing
becomes a living process that helps you find true North. The name
of the game here is how fast you can find out you are wrong. Being right is fun,
but it never helps you grow.</p>
<p>To expose your ideas to the limelight of the truth is to see just
how strong the rational bedrock of your thoughts really are. Where do they crumble?
Where do you need to rebuild?</p>
