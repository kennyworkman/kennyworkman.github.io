      <description>No one wants to write. Usually in college you&amp;rsquo;re writing about something boring, and you&amp;rsquo;d rather do anything else.
There&amp;rsquo;s a certain permanence to the written word that can be scary. Thoughts are fleeting and lossy, but there&amp;rsquo;s comfort in this lack of state. Its easy to confide in your strokes of genius or dismiss stupidity when such musings pass as quickly as they come.
Distilling a set of complex thoughts into a sentence or paragraph forever exposes the captured idea to the lens of public scrutiny.</description>
